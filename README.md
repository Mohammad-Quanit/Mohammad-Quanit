## üëã Hi I am Mohammad Quanit - pronounced as [(Qa-nit)](https://www.nameslook.com/qanit/)

Hi üëã, I am Mohammad Quanit, and I'm a Software engineer at [10Pearls](https://10pearls.com/). I have overall 4 years of experience in software engineering in which I've been mostly working on Javascript alongside its frameworks. I do write tech articles for different publications as well and have experience as a tech speaker in different local and international conferences as well. Experienced in JavaScript-based tech-stacks such as Angular, React, and NodeJS on small to large scale projects and now learning advanced backend development with Golang as i'm in love this language.

I do content writing for the community, so check my blogging website for my blogs that I've written on, <br />
