## I'm a Software Engineer :computer: working on [10Pearls](https://10pearls.com/)

Hi üëã, I am Mohammad Quanit, and I am working as a Software engineer at 10Pearls. I have overall 3.6 years of experience as a software engineer in which I've been mostly working on Javascript alongside its frameworks. I do write tech articles for different publications as well and have experience as a tech speaker in different local and international conferences as well. Experienced in JavaScript-based tech-stacks such as Angular, React, and NodeJS on small to large scale projects and now learning advanced backend development as I am looking to switch on the backend development side.

I do content writing for the community, so check my blogging website for my blogs that I've written on, <br />
